  <p> I am a PhD student in the College of Computer and Information Sciences at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.  I work in the Knowledge Discovery Lab with David Jensen.  My research interests include causal learning, expanding causal modelling techniques to temporal data, and anomaly detection.  I'm also interested in evaluation of causal discovery algorithms and how assumptions analyses change when we move to a more expressive representation.
